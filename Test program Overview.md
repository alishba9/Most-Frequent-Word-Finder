# Most-Frequent-Word-Finder
To check the functionality of your program, you will develop a Java class called "FindKeyWordsInFileTest" for this assignment. The testing program must take three arguments: an integer value k, the name of an input file, and the name of a text file containing a list of the most frequent English words. The following 6 test cases must be included in your testing program:
• Test to check if the program reads the input file and creates the word frequency correctly.
• Test to check if the program finds the k most frequent words correctly.
• Test to check if the program filters common English words correctly.
• Test to check if the program generates the correct output for file3.txt.
• Test to check if the program handles empty input files.
• Test to check if the program handles non-existing input files.
You will need to run your tests using the command line, passing in the appropriate arguments for each
test case. Your tests should output whether each test passed or failed, along with any relevant error
messages. Your test program must include any necessary exception handling.
